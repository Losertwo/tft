    <div class="q-1">1 // How can I get involved?</div>
    <div class="a-1">Think about freedom, and act on your thoughts. Spend your dollars wisely. Oppose the expansion of state power. Promote "bottom-up" solutions to public problems, solutions that empower individuals rather than demanding intervention by force of government.</div>
    <div class="q-2">2 // Iâ€™m worried because my dog seems aggressive/dangerous. Can you help me?</div>
    <div class="a-2">We will give you advice on the situation surrounding the behavior, but that is no substitute for getting professional help from a qualified trainer immediately. Aggression is no joke - it can be managed successfully, but if you wait, it can destroy the lives of people and animals around you and get your dog euthanized if something horrible happens. </div>
    <div class="q-3">3 // What is anthropocentrism?</div>
    <div class="a-3">The belief (often inherent and sub-concious) that humans are the most significant species on earth; that humans and human experience is best, more important, of higher value, and more moral than that of animals; assessment of reality through a human-centric lens.</div>
    <div class="q-4">4 // My dog barks a lot! Why does she do that?</div>
    <div class="a-4">Dogs can bark for lots of reasons, and it's very situational. Dogs bark as a self-referential behavior indicating internal conflict (I want to get to that dog, but there's a door in the way!). This can either be excitement barking or stress barking. Dogs can also learn to use barking as a way to communicate with humans or other dogs. </div>
